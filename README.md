# Classifier Comparison App

This is a web application built with Streamlit that allows users to compare the performance of two classifiers—Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—on different datasets. Users can choose from three datasets (Iris, Wine, and Digits) and select various SVM kernel types to visualize decision boundaries and model accuracy.

## Features

- **Dataset Selection**: Choose between the Iris, Wine, and Digits datasets.
- **Classifier Choice**: Select between Random Forest and SVM.
- **Kernel Option for SVM**: Choose the kernel type for SVM (linear, poly, rbf, sigmoid).
- **Model Evaluation**: Displays model accuracy and visualizes decision boundaries for SVM.

## Demo

You can access the app live on Streamlit Cloud Link -> https://ml-models-comparision-app.streamlit.app/.
